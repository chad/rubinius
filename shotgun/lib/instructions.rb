  # [Description]
  #   If the object is an instance of +\class+ return the special value +true+,
  #   otherwise return +false+. This check is different than +kind_of+ in that
  #   it does not evaluate superclass relationships. Instance-specific
  #   subtyping via metaclasses are ignored in computing the parent \class.

  # [Operation]
  #   Pauses execution and yields to the debugger
  # [Format]
  #   \yield_debugger
  # [Stack Before]
  #   * ...
  # [Stack After]
  #   * ...
  # [Description]
  #   Pauses virtual machine execution at the \yield_debugger instruction, and
  #   yields control to the debugger on the debug channel. If no debugger is
  #   registered, an error is raised.
  # [Notes]
  #   The \yield_debugger instruction is VM plumbing that exists to support
  #   "full-speed" debugging. As such, it is not output by the compiler, but
  #   rather is used by the debugger to replace an existing instruction at a
  #   breakpoint. Prior to encountering a \yield_debugger instruction, the VM
  #   will execute normally, i.e. at full speed, and not be slowed
  #   significantly by the fact that a debugger is attached.
  #
  #   When the debugger is yielded to by this instruction, it can examine the
  #   execution context, stack, etc, or replace the \yield_debugger instruction
  #   with the original instruction at that point, and then step through the
  #   code.

  #   without any method calls.
  #
  #   For two Fixnums, two Symbols, or two literals (+true+, +false+, +nil+),
  #   return +true+ if the values are identical.
  #
  #   For two object references (including Bignum), return +true+ if value1

  # [Stack Before]
  #   * obj
  #   * ...
  # [Stack After]
  #   * true | false
  #   * ...
  # [Description]
  #   Pops an object off the stack, and determines whether the serial number
  #   of the method identified by the literal +method+ is the same as the
  #   expected value +serial+. The result is pushed back on the stack as the
  #   value +true+ or +false+.
  # [Notes]
  #   This opcode is typically used to determine at runtime whether an
  #   optimisation can be performed. At compile time, two code paths are
  #   generated: a slow, but guaranteed correct path, and a fast path that
  #   uses certain optimisations. The serial number check is then performed at
  #   runtime to determine which code path is executed.
  #
  #   For example, a method such as Fixnum#times can be optimised at compile
  #   time, but we can't know until runtime whether or not the Fixnum#times
  #   method has been overridden. The serial number check is used to determine
  #   each time the code is executed, whether or not the standard Fixnum#times
  #   has been overridden. It leverages the serial number field on a
  #   CompiledMethod, is initialised to either 0 (for kernel land methods) or
  #   1 (for user land methods).
